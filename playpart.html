                [The same room. The mist still lies heavy over the landscape.]
            </p>
            <p >
                [MANDERS and MRS. ALVING enter from the dining-room.]
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>MRS. ALVING.</b> 
                [Still in the doorway.]
                Velbekomme [Note: A phrase equivalent to the 
                German Prosit die Mahlzeit--May good digestion wait on appetite.], 
                Mr. Manders.[Turns back towards the 
                dining-room.]Aren't you coming too, Oswald?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>OSWALD.</b> [From within.] No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>MRS. ALVING.</b> Yes, do. The weather seems 
                a little brighter now.[She shuts the dining-room 
                door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] Regina!
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>REGINA.</b>[Outside.] Yes, Mrs. Alving?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>MRS. ALVING.</b> Go down to the laundry, 
                and help with the garlands.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>REGINA.</b> Yes, Mrs. Alving.
            </p>
            <p>
                [MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; 
                    then shuts the door.]
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>MANDERS.</b> I suppose he cannot overhear us 
                in there?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>MRS. ALVING.</b> Not when the door is shut.
                 Besides, he's just going out.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>MANDERS.</b> I am still quite upset. I don't 
                know how I could swallow a morsel of dinner.
